My name is Juan Sebastián Vélez-Velásquez and I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Arizona.  My research covers topics in Industrial Organization, Microeconometrics, Regulation and Public Policy.

<br> 

I am currently on the job market and will be available for interviews at the AEA conference in January.
